# TODO

- Test contact us page safely

- General
  - Host js for gallery, rather than using public cdn versions
  - convert to REM and use CSS variables for better responsive scaling
  - Add in contentSecurityPolicy
  - Make build to dist, build dist using gitlab actions?, get rid of docs. This would be more consistent, but probably only worth it if mosving hosting elsewhere.
