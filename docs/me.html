    <p>I am Monir, originally from Iran. I grew up in a big family with seven siblings. I have gained massive life experience through playing with my sisters, and this has had a good effect on my passion in my life.</p>
    <p>I have been working in Mashhadâ€™s Cultural Heritage organization for about six years. I have also done a lot of pottery and ceramics with other groups and as a hobby.</p>
    <p>When I moved to England in November 2010, I started to get more qualifications for being a primary school teacher. I started working in a school, but I missed my passion of pottery so started to run workshops instead.</p>
    <p>I love to work with kids, also cycling, gardening and moutain climbing.</p>
    <p>I am very active in my local community in Brighton and my aim is to help people experience the joy of bringing beauty out of the clay. Working with clay can have a therepeutic effect with lots of amazing benefits.</p>
