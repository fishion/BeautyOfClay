  <img src="img/monir.jpg" class="main">

  <p>I am Monir, originally from Persia (Iran), where I worked in Mashhadâ€™s Cultural Heritage organisation for over six years. I also ran pottery and ceramics groups.</p>
  <p>When I moved to England in 2010, I trained to become a primary school teacher and started working in a school. But soon began to miss my passion for pottery. I left the school to set up Beauty of Clay, a social enterprise.</p>
  <p>I believe working with clay can have a therapeutic effect with lots of amazing benefits. I'm hoping to provide exposure to, and understanding of, Persian design principles. And through this to encourage and teach people to develop a sensitivity and understanding of the medium, and express this in their own creations.</p>
