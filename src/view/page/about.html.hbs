<h1>About</h1>

<img src="img/monir.jpg" class="main" />

<p>
  I am Monir, originally from Persia (Iran), where I worked in Mashhad’s Cultural Heritage
  organisation for over six years. I also ran pottery and ceramics groups.
</p>

<p>
  When I moved to England in 2010, I trained to become a primary school teacher and started working
  in a school. But soon began to miss my passion for pottery. I left the school to set up Beauty of
  Clay, a social enterprise.
</p>

<p>
  I have recently been exploring my own art through children's drawings which I am finding very
  fascinating. Kids drawings are a precious &amp; valuable form of art that can offer unique
  insights into their minds and imagination. They are full of creativity, freedom and innocence. I
  believe each child is an artist who has an infinite ability to create art pieces that are not
  comparable with any other art form.
</p>

<p>
  Working with clay can also have a therapeutic effect with lots of amazing benefits. I'm hoping to
  provide exposure and understanding of Persian design principles. And through this to encourage and
  teach people to develop a sensitivity and understanding of the medium, and express this in their
  own creations.
