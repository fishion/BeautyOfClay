<h1>About</h1>

<img src="img/gallery/gallery13.jpg">

<p>I am Monir, originally from Persia, where I worked in Mashhadâ€™s Cultural Heritage organization for over six years alongside running pottery and ceramics groups.</p>
<p>When I moved to England in 2010, I trained to become a primary school teacher and started working in a school. But soon began to miss my passion of pottery so left the school to set up Beauty of Clay social enterprise and run workshops.</p>
<p>I am very active in my local community in Brighton, UK and my aim is to help people experience the joy of bringing beauty out of the clay.</p>
<p>I believe working with clay can have a therapeutic effect with lots of amazing benefits. I'm hoping to provide exposure to, and understanding of, Persian design principles. And through this to encourage and teach people to develop a sensitivity and understanding of the medium, and express this in their own creations.</p>
